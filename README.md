### What I learned

One thing I learned doing this project was how to change the order of the elements being displayed with flexbox. I was a little stumped once I started working on the mobile layout. My basic layout for this app involved one parent container with 2 children that hold the text container and the image container for the left and right sides. 
I used flexbox with a flex-direction of flex to align the children. When styling for mobile, I changed the flex direction of the container to row. My problem was that I needed the img to be on top of the text but it was at the bottom because it's the second child. 
After googling a bit, I stumbled upon the reverse property for flex-direction, this allowed me to move the img child to be on top. 
It was really cool to learn a little trick like that from this project. 

### Continued development

Something I want to continue looking into is the img position/scaling in the mobile layout. I had a bit of trouble matching the sample img, my img was focused on a slightly different section of the picture.
